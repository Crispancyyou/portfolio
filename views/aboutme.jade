      p
        | I am an 
        strong Electromechanical Engineering Technician Student 
        | with a passion for innovation and problem-solving. Alongside my technical background, I am the owner of a self-employed business specializing in 
        strong full-stack web development.
      p 
        | My expertise spans frontend and backend development, database management, and iOS app development. With a strong foundation in engineering principles and coding, I deliver creative and efficient solutions tailored to individual and business needs.
      p 
        | This portfolio highlights my diverse range of skills and projects, showcasing my ability to bridge the gap between engineering and modern software development.

      p 
        | I have completed numerous projects across all aspects of web development, including the development of a 
        strong custom workflow optimization program 
        | for Ontario Power Generation (OPG). Built with a 
        strong Python Flask 
        | backend, 
        strong HTML/CSS/JavaScript 
        | frontend, a 
        strong SQLite 
        | database, and integrated 
        strong API 
        | data access, this program was designed to enhance efficiency, safety, and collaboration by:

      ul
        li Automating routing sheet creation, significantly reducing manual workload and ensuring consistent accuracy.
        li Providing streamlined access to engineering drawings and related documents for cross-departmental teams.
        li Cross-checking and validating assignments to ensure no two individuals were working on the same drawing simultaneously, preventing conflicts and redundancies.
        li Implementing safety checks to verify that future revisions had not already been created, safeguarding against errors in version control.
        li Performing complex calculations and advanced data analysis to optimize workflows and support decision-making processes.
        li Offering a user-friendly interface that enabled non-technical staff to navigate and utilize the system effectively, enhancing overall productivity.

      p 
        | My expertise also includes:
        ul
          li Full-stack development (frontend and backend) with languages such as Node.js, PHP, and Python.
          li Database design and management, particularly SQL, integrated into web applications for robust data handling.
          li Creating responsive and interactive user interfaces using modern frontend technologies to deliver engaging user experiences.
